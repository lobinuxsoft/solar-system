  planetInfo: Saturn distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities
    to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn
    has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 MEarth.
    Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water.
    The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 83
    confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus,
    show signs of geological activity they, as well as five other Saturnian moons
    (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Mimas), are large enough to be round. Titan,
    the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only
    satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.
