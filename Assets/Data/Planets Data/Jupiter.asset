  planetInfo: 'Jupiter is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together.
    It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter''s strong internal heat
    creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the
    Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 80 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede,
    Callisto, Io, and Europa, are called the Galilean moons: they show similarities
    to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede,
    the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury; Callisto is
    almost as large.'
