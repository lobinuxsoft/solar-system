  planetInfo: Earth is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one
    known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known
    to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and
    it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere
    is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by
    the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite,
    the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.
