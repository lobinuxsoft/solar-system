  planetInfo: "Venus is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, has a thick silicate
    mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal
    geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety
    times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with
    surface temperatures over 400 \xB0C, most likely due to the amount of greenhouse
    gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity
    has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion
    of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished
    by volcanic eruptions."
