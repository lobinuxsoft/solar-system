  planetInfo: The dwarf planet Pluto is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt.
    When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth planet; this changed
    in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively
    eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7
    AU (4.44 billion km; 2.76 billion mi) from the Sun at perihelion (within the
    orbit of Neptune) to 49.5 AU (7.41 billion km; 4.60 billion mi) at aphelion.
    Pluto has a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round
    the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share
    this resonance are called plutinos.
