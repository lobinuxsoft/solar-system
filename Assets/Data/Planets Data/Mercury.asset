  planetInfo: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet in the
    Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its
    only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced
    by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere
    consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large
    iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses
    include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it
    was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.
