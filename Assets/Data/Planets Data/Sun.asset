  planetInfo: 'The Sun is the Solar System''s star and by far its most massive component.
    Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass
    in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough
    to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This releases an enormous
    amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking
    in visible light.

    

    Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium, it
    is a main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence star,
    where the type designation refers to its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence
    stars are more luminous. The Sun''s temperature is intermediate between that
    of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter
    than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as
    red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the stars in the Milky Way.'
