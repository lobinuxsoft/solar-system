  planetInfo: Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence
    more dense. It radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter
    or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically
    active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with
    a retrograde orbit, which indicates that it did not form with Neptune, but was
    probably captured from the Kuiper belt. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by
    several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with
    it.
