  planetInfo: Mars is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly
    carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that
    of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and
    rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have
    persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from
    iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and
    Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive
    impact early in Mars's history.
